        <p>Now its Johnny<br>Hi, my name is Johnny. I was born on the 15 of December in London, England. Ever since i was 5 years old i would watch YouTube all the time and want to start my own channel. Then i met Arron and we thought it would be a good idea to make a YouTube channel. Even if we don't go viral we still really enjoy making videos for the fun of it. Anyways, thank you for everyones support and we love you all. Goodbye!</p>
